0) The input files are labels and text descriptions. 

1) nlp-pg.py generates 4 output files: trainid.csv, testid.csv, dict.csv and allwords.csv; model.Rmd 
takes the trainid.csv, testid.csv and allwords.csv as input, and generates a html file (model.html) 
that gives the explanation, code, results and plots.

2) You have to have nltk for the python code nlp-pg.py to run, and you have to have RStudio with 
'knitr' package installed. All other R packages are automatically installed by the code.

3) Open 'words-NB-lasso.html' to read about the steps I have done.

4) Each code has its own description, if interested please open respective file and read more about the steps.
Thank you.
